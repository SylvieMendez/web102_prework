## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges: 

* [ ] Managing dynamic content: Ensuring that filtering games, adding top-funded games, and appending new <p> elements didnâ€™t overwrite existing HTML.
* [ ] Search functionality: Implementing a search feature that filters games in real-time and scrolls automatically to the results section.
* [ ] Layout and styling: Adjusting the header, search bar, and game cards to prevent layout shifts, while making the page visually appealing and readable.
* [ ] Responsive design: Aligning the header, logo, nav links, and search bar so they display well on different screen sizes.
* [ ] UX considerations: Softening bright container backgrounds, adding hover effects, and ensuring smooth scrolling for a better user experience.
